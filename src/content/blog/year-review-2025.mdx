What did you do this year that you’d never done before?
找女生要微信。五六月份的时候，经常去家附近的温泉小镇做作品集，餐馆的服务员很漂亮，声音不嗲很自然的那种好听。
用ai写算法
和研发共创产品
Did you keep your new year’s resolutions?
今年新年的健康、家人健康的愿望，都算实现了吧。去年的40问，我说要有更健康的身体，减肥了一点点应该算吧，加上不吃小面（被迫）了，应该算是健康了吧；关于更好的愿意付出热情的工作，我觉得今年算是找到了，做的事情确实比较有趣，我很喜欢，难度比较高，我觉得很有价值
Did anyone close to you give birth?
没有
Did anyone close to you die?
没有
What cities/states/countries did you visit?
上海算不，工作来上海了，但来了快半年了，还没逛过。
What would you like to have next year that you lacked this year?
攒够20w（算上手里的钱和投资的钱）
上线10款产品，我现在的卡点是上线产品，明天上线插件了，我要去看看阿译（前端同学）怎么做的
每周跑2次步
拍500张照片
What date(s) from this year will remain etched upon your memory, and why?
找工作的那1个月时间，每天都在准备面试、面试词、作品集、想请假理由
8月到现在，我每天都把自己逼得很紧，每天上班都在感觉时间不够用了，项目、产品做不出来，工作日每天都在加班
What was your biggest achievement of the year?
找到一份新工作，这个公司平台很大，老板愿意给我时间资源做事情，我觉得我之前努力做作品集和学习ai是值得的
What was your biggest failure?
精力管理、项目管理、时间分配很失败，没有把时间分配到值得80%精力的地方，导致软件上线时间一直在拖延；
项目评估失败，在启动之前，我应该和主管分析清楚，这个ai链路产品，很难做出来，具体难在哪，我们可以先做别的，比如现在更被+2看好的AIUI
